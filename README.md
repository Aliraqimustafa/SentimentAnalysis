# Sentiment Analysis using IMDb Data

Welcome to this repository! Here, we will walk through an example of applying sentiment analysis in a real project. In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using the TF-IDF technology. We achieved high accuracy on the training data, but also encountered the challenge of overfitting.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in running this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aliraqimustafa/SentimentAnalysis.git

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

3. Download the IMDb dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

4. Place the downloaded dataset in the appropriate directory and update the file path in the `main.ipynb` file.

5. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook and run all the cells.

## Running on Kaggle

Alternatively, if you prefer to work on Kaggle, you can follow these steps:

1. Access the IMDb dataset on Kaggle from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

2. Create a new notebook on Kaggle.

3. Copy all the cells from the `main.ipynb` notebook in this repository and paste them into your Kaggle notebook.

4. Run all the cells to execute the project.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the project to learn more about sentiment analysis and the TF-IDF technique. Happy analyzing!
